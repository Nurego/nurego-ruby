This file provides short explanations, of how to run the examples
The examples themselves are not very comprehensive and mostly serve for testing purposes.

(i.e. how the payload should look like etc)

There are two setup functions

1. example_set_api_key - sets the api API key and the URL (default is localhost)

you should provide the api key from any real (working) instance you have

I you want to test subscription EXAMPLE_EMAIL should be changed


2. example_set_uaa_client

This sets uaa client and works only for Nurego instances


To run one of the examples use:

cd nurego_ruby
bundle install
ruby -I./lib examples/login.rb


 offering = Nurego::Offering.current
    offering.plans.each do |plan|
      plan.features.each do |feature|
        puts feature.inspect
      end
    end
